    "### Rules\n",
    " Rules are simple. Shoot others and don't let them shoot you.\n",
    " \n",
    " The game runs in ticks (15 per second). \n",
    " Every tick you can either rotate, move step forward or shoot (if you have ammo).\n",
    " \n",
    " When killed, your bot respawns after 5 seconds. \n",
    " When you are out of ammo, the gun will be reloaded after 5 seconds (note that the reload timer resets when you die).\n",
    " \n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "1. fill in your email to the cell below\n",
    "2. Run the first cell, live arena will show and your bot will connect\n",
    "3. Run the second cell, your bot will spawn and will be driven by a simple \"Walk&Shoot\" algorithm.\n",
    "4. Modify the code of second cell and rerun it to update bots policy\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    "- The `arena-bulanci` framework contains a lot of utility methods (e.g. tools for bullet avoidance)\n",
    "  - basic ones are already used in the example bot implementation\n",
    "  - more advanced features are documented here https://github.com/m9ra/arena-bulanci/blob/master/arena_bulanci/bots/bot_base.py#L25\n",
    "   \n",
    " - For detailed API reference and more execution options besides Jupyter notebook look here: https://github.com/m9ra/arena-bulanci\n",
